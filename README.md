This project implements linear regression from scratch using NumPy, with support for both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. The implementation includes:

Basic linear regression with gradient descent

Regularized regression (L1, L2, or ElasticNet)

Feature normalization

Visualization tools for simple linear regression

Support for polynomial features

One-hot encoding for categorical variables
